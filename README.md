# Image-Uploader

A web app that enables users to host images on the cloud and get links to their images that can be shared outside. 
Users can create an account, login to a session, host images in an AWS bucket and retrieve them, and logout of their session.

This project uses Node.js (with Express) as its backend, MongoDB as its database client and React for its frontend. The app performs both 
client-side and server-side validation and the code is linted using airbnb-lint.
